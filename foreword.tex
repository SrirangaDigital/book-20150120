\chapter*{Foreword}

\thispagestyle{empty}

It gives me immense pleasure to present before you this book on {\bf BASIC ELECTRONICS} authored by my colleague Dr. U.B. Mahadevaswamy. The book has been carefully drafted with enormous number of practical examples to support the theoretical concepts explained in this book. Difficult concepts are explained in simple and easily understandable terms backed by ample illustrations.

This book is a result of over 25 years of teaching experience of the author at various levels. I am sure that the readers will find the book extremely useful from both theoretical and practical point of view.

I wish the author success and sincerely hope that more publications would emerge out of his vast experience of teaching and research in electronics.
